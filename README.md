# Image Classifier Project

## Overview

I am working on a project to develop an image classifier capable of identifying 100 different objects, including categories such as birds, cats, dogs, airplanes, and many others. This project leverages machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing TensorFlow for the implementation.

The classifier is designed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to effectively recognize and categorize the objects in the images. One of the key components in the model's architecture is the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, which helps in accelerating the training process and achieving better performance by introducing non-linearity into the network.

After training the model extensively on a large dataset to ensure high accuracy and robustness, the trained model is saved as a Keras file. This Keras file encapsulates the architecture, weights, and training configuration of the neural network, making it easier to load and deploy the model for practical applications.
